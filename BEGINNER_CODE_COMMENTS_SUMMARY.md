/**
 * SERVICE SELECTION LOGIC - BEGINNER EXPLANATION
 * ===============================================
 * 
 * This function manages which water activities the user has chosen.
 * 
 * HOW IT WORKS:
 * 1. User taps on a service card (Jet Ski, Aqua Lounge, or Tours)
 * 2. We check if that service is already in our list
 * 3. If it's already selected ‚Üí Remove it (toggle off)
 * 4. If it's not selected ‚Üí Add it to the list (toggle on)
 * 
 * TECHNICAL DETAILS:
 * - selectedServices is an array like: ['jetski', 'tours']
 * - includes() checks if a value exists in the array
 * - filter() creates a new array without the unwanted item
 * - [...array, newItem] adds an item to the array (spread operator)

 * This function checks if an email address is properly formatted.
 * It uses a "regular expression" (regex) pattern to validate.
 * 
 * WHAT THE REGEX PATTERN MEANS:
 * ^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$
 * 
 * Breaking it down:
 * ^ = Start of string

 * @ = Must contain exactly one @ symbol
 * [^\s@]+ = One or more characters that are NOT spaces or @ symbols  
 * \. = Must contain a dot (period)
 * [^\s@]+ = One or more characters that are NOT spaces or @ symbols
 * $ = End of string
 * 
 * EXAMPLES:
 * ‚úÖ john@email.com (valid)
 * ‚úÖ user.name@company.co.nz (valid)
 * ‚ùå john@email (invalid - missing .com)
 * ‚ùå @email.com (invalid - missing username)
 * ‚ùå john email@test.com (invalid - contains space)
 */
```

/**
 * REVIEW DATA FETCHING - BEGINNER EXPLANATION
 * ==========================================
 * 
 * This function retrieves all customer reviews from our Firebase database.
 * Think of it like loading comments on a YouTube video or reviews on Amazon.
 * 
 * HOW IT WORKS:
 * 1. Contact Firebase database and ask for all reviews
 * 2. Sort them by newest first (orderBy createdAt desc)
 * 3. Go through each review document one by one
 * 4. Convert the database format into our app's format
 * 5. Handle any broken or missing data gracefully
 * 6. Display the reviews to the user
 * 
 * ERROR HANDLING:
 * ‚Ä¢ If database is unreachable ‚Üí Show error message
 * ‚Ä¢ If a review has missing data ‚Üí Use default values
 * ‚Ä¢ If date conversion fails ‚Üí Use current date
 * ‚Ä¢ Always show something to the user (even if empty)
 */
```

### üìù **Review Submission Process**
**Location:** Lines 300-400  
**Complex Features:** Authentication, validation, Firebase security, optimistic updates

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**
```typescript
/**
 * REVIEW SUBMISSION PROCESS - BEGINNER EXPLANATION
 * ===============================================
 * 
 * This is the main function that handles when a user submits their review.
 * It's like processing a form submission on a website.
 * 
 * STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS:
 * 1. Hide the keyboard (better user experience)
 * 2. Validate all form fields (name, email, text, rating)

## üéØ PRESENTATION TALKING POINTS

### **For Technical Interviews:**

1. **"Can you explain how the booking calculation works?"**
   - "The pricing engine uses a simple accumulator pattern where we start with zero and add costs based on selected services. Each service has different pricing logic - jet skis multiply by quantity, while Aqua Lounge is a flat rate."

2. **"How do you handle offline scenarios?"**
   - "We use an offline-first approach where bookings are saved locally first, then synced to Firebase. If the network fails, we queue the data and retry automatically when connection returns."

3. **"Explain your form validation strategy."**
   - "We implement client-side validation using regex patterns for emails and range checks for ratings. The validation runs before submission and provides specific error messages for each field."

4. **"How does the AI integration work?"**
   - "We use optimistic updates - the user's message appears immediately while the AI processes in the background. This creates a responsive chat experience even with network latency."

### **For Business Presentations:**

1. **"This booking system handles complex business rules..."**
   - Point to the pricing calculation comments showing multi-service support

2. **"Our AI assistant provides 24/7 customer support..."**
   - Highlight the real-time chat features and error handling

3. **"The review system builds customer trust..."**
   - Show the validation and security features that prevent spam

4. **"Everything works offline for reliability..."**
   - Demonstrate the offline-first approach in booking confirmation
